# 105-unit-3

This is a repository containing instructional materials and datasets for Prof. Gotzler’s fall 2022 004 section of ENGL-105 at the University of Carolina, Chapel Hill.  

The repository consists of four python notebooks. Three explain how to use the Pandas package for data analysis with basic coding and markdown tools. One outlines step by step instructions on how to create your own subset of data from a larger database.   

# Where is this data from

The materials have been adapted from the excellent lessons created by the staff at the [Research Hub](https://library.unc.edu/data/) of UNC’s Davis Library.

The County Public Health Dataset provides tabular data on a variety of health-related issues in all US counties.  

# What is the focus of this data

This data is used to analyze the contributors of food security in Florida counties. Data is pulled from the County Public Health Dataset and merged into a table that allows people to see how limited access to healthy food and median household income correlate to having a poor food environment index.  

This data subset gives data on the 17 highest scoring food index counties in the state of Florida.  

# Using the data

After following the tutorial, people should be able to replicate this process to study other contributors of food security or other affected counties or regions.
